/*
In addition to the java.util.function package, Java also provides the java.util.stream package for functional programming needs.

Stream: represents a sequence of elements from a collection, array or other input source.
-stream does not store elements like collections do, but instead, allows us to perform operations on the data without modifying the original source.

The stream API also provides a method to process operations on the elements in parallel. When doing so, multiple threads are used to process the elements of the stream at the same time.
The stream API is a powerful tool for data processing.
