/*
Polymorphism: is where subclass can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same behaviors of
 the super class

-Type vs Instance: an object can have a superclass type and a subclass instance
-Overridden methods: if a method is overridden by the subclass, the polymorphic object will execute the
overridden method at runtime
e.g. Animal sasha = new Dog();
