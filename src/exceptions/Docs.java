/*
Exception is an event that occurs at runtime due to an error.
An exception disrupts the normal flow of a program.

Exception handling gives us greater control over the user experience of our applications.
We can handle exceptions within our code so that, instead of allowing the program to crash we handle exception in a graceful manner.
