/*
Abstraction: is something that exists in theory but does not have concrete existence
-in Java we have reserved word abstract
-abstract is non-access modifier
-It can be used when we want to define a template for a class or method, but do not intend for it to be used as is.

-an Abstract class is not designed to be instantiated, but it's designed to be extended, thus pushing the burden of implementation onto the subclass
-any class that contains an abstract method must be abstract itself
-an abstract class can contain implemented methods as well

-an Abstract method has no body, only signature of method is defined, and is not designed to be run as is, it
is designed to be overwritten by a subclass
